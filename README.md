# Web Development - _NASA_APOD_

This web app: **This app can show the astronomy picture of the day randomly.**


The following functionality is completed:

- [x] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [x] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [x] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [x] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
  - [x] To ensure an accurate grade, the recording **must** show that when clicked, an attribute in the ban list is immediately removed from the list of banned attributes
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

- [x] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [x] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session
